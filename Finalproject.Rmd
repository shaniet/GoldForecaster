(We don't have to polish this RMD in terms of labels or descriptions. Final presentation will be in powerpoint. We'll still submit this as the source code though so we should still be commenting what we're doing with code) Jon

Load Data
```{r}
# Read csv
gold <- read.csv("gold.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)

# Omit all rows that have NA vals
gold <- na.omit(gold)
```

Variable Selection
```{r}
# Run Boruta  algorithm on clean data
library(Boruta)
library(randomForest)
boruta.gold <- Boruta(PercChangeForc~.-Date -Average.Price -Oil -PPIJewelry, data = gold, doTrace = 2, 
                       randomForest = TRUE)

plot(boruta.gold)
```

Create Cross Validation Folds
```{r}

```
